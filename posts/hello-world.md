# Hello World

This is the first article in my test blog.

## What?

This is a prototype for a GitHub-based blog which I'm using to develop my website, http://t0ast.cc.

I'm building the site according to the JAMstack and I thought about using GitHub as a storage medium for my blog posts.
'Why' you might ask? Well, there are a lot of reasons for using GitHub (or any other Git hosting service):
 * Good uptime
 * I don't have to worry about keeping the service up
 * Built-in version control (if I wanna use that at some point on my site)
 * Built-in contributors tracking
 * Webhooks that I can use to trigger an automatic rebuild from my site generator (which is probably gonna be on Netlify)
